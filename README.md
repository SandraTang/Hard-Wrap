# Hard-Wrap
Hard Wrap is a strategic dodging and shooting action game where you fend off an endless stream of monsters. However, unlike many similar games, you can't spam your way to successâ€”your own lasers wrap around the screen and can hit you if you're not careful! Also, you have the ability to teleport.

Hard Wrap was created by Sandra Tang, David Tang and Stella Saw at Code Day LA (Fall 2017) in under 24 hours and won the Best Game award. #arcade
